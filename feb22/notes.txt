useful:
window.requestAnimationFrame(<fxn>)

tells browser to run specified fxn before drawing next frame
allows browser to handle when code should be executed (as opposed to setInterval
which is based on specific times).
allows browser to pause animation when a page is no in foreground
fxn must call requestAnimationFrame() to animate another frame at next repaint
Browser will attempt to run 60 frames per second
