XML:
eXtensible Markup Lanuage
markup lanuage defines set of rules for encoding doc in format
both human and machine readable

not formating language like html
framework for creating markup based grammars
uses some syntactic stands of html(tags,attriubutes)
focus on sorting and represneting data instead of rendering, displaying it
xml namespace defined by tags and attributes assoicated with specifc xml lanauge

SVG:
scalable vector graphics
vector image format
xml based
an svg img and its actions defined in xml text files

vector graphics are images not represented as a 2d grid of pixels(raster) but instead as a list of drawing commadns (like line circle, rectange curve)

biggest advantage to vector graphics is that they are scalable any size without resulting in pixelation

the <svg> elment is designed to store SVG code

creating svg elements in js
document.createElementNS(
	<namespace identifer>
	<element>
);

creates an element from a specified XML namepace svg example:
var c1 = document.createElementNS("www.w3.org/2000/svg","circle");

Once created you can modify it with setAttribute calls c1.setAttribute("cx","200")

to add element to svg container use appendchild

var pic = document.getElementById("svgid");
pic.appendChild(c1);
